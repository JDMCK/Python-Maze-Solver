# Python Maze Solver

![maze_solver](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c48b1b5f-2406-43cd-9258-df968796c4d1)

## Description
This is a maze solving program built with Python and rendered using Turtle. It utilizes two backtracking search algorithms, depth-first and breadth-first seach. The default setting is breadth-first however, simply to get the best path.

## Usage
To use this program, simply download the maze_solver.py file and run it however you please. Feel free to look around the code, especially near the top where I define some mazes that you can play around with and design yourself.
